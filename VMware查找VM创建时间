Hi everyone! Just dropping by to share with you a couple of lazy style one-liners which will allow you to acquire useful information from your Hyper-V VMs. More specifically, the creation time of which your Hyper-V VMs were originally created.


Get a list of the non-running and running VMs and their creation time. To be used with standalone Hyper-V hosts.
Get-VM * | Select-Object VMName,CreationTime | Sort-Object CreationTime
PowerShellCopy
Get the creation time of a particular VM. To be used with standalone Hyper-V hosts.

PowerShellCopy
